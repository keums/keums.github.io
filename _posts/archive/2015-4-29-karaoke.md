This is my term project of GCT501 in GSCT,KAIST.
It need to separated vocal source to estimate pitch of singer's voice.
I applied very simple but rough algorithm of source separation, subtracting instrument version signal from its original signal. In order to estimate pitch, I used YIN algorithm.

I made this system using Max/MSP 7.
